                <p class="project_description">The largest project I've worked on is a photo editor. The project was group based and foccused heavily on CI/CD pipelines and git integration. We had automated tests running to make sure the program was fucntioning correctly. Using java I developed image proccessing classes, different filters, drawing tools and kernel opperations. The tool can access files on your computer to load in and perform opperations on them. Files that have been altered can then be saved locally and worked on later. Overall the entire project contained approximatley 35 files which helped me develop skills to manage larger tasks.</p>
